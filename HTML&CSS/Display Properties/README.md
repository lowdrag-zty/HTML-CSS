<!-- Display Block Inline Inline-Block box-sizing:border-box -->

In HTML, elements could generally be summarized into blocks and inline

The browser respects top bottom margin and padding for block elements.

The browser doesn't respect top bottom margin and padding for inline elements.

If we want to show inline elements as block, we could use display: block
If we want to keep the appearance of inline, but equip it with block's properties, we could use display: inline-block

Compare those three:

- display: none
- opacity: 0
- visibility: hidden

PS: You could check the 'check' png to make sure
